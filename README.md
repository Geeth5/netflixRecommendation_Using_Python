## üéØ Project Outcomes

  -> Using the first model, i.e recommendation based on features like director, country, cast, and genre we get five other Bollywood movies originated from India with very similar genres. This is a satisfactory result based on our personal experience and public opinion.
  
  -> Using the second model, i.e recommendation based on the keywords in the description we get five movies, some of which are Bollywood and some are Hollywood. This result is not satisfactory according to our personal experience and public opinion. The reason behind this is that the descriptions may have similar keywords but not be related at all as seen in this example.
